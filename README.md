## About
This mini-project is part of our module SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on popularity of video games in 2016. For easy navigation, you may choose to use the below hyperlink to access the full and complete notebook:

Otherwise, you may also look at our individual notebooks split into different junctures of the project:

1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ngzxzxzx/SC1015/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb)
2. [Problem Formulation 1, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/ngzxzxzx/SC1015/blob/main/Problem%20Formulation%20and%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
3. [Regression Models](https://github.com/ngzxzxzx/SC1015/blob/main/Regression%20Models.ipynb)
4. [Problem Formulation 2, Classification Models](https://github.com/ngzxzxzx/SC1015/blob/main/Classification_Methods.ipynb)


## Problem Formulation
1. Are we able to predict Global Sales (Response) using other variables (Predictors) from our data? 
2. What is the most important feature in predicting Global Sales? (Feature Importance)
3. Are we able to identify whether a video game is popular or not? (Classification) 


## Models Used
<br> </br>
Regression Models:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Ridge Regression
- XG Boost
<br></br>
Classification Models:
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classification


## Conclusion and Key Insights
- Regression models were not very successful in predicting Global Sales, given the low R^2 values.
- However, we can identify (the most) important features while trying to predict Global Sales. In our results, we found that the number of Metacritic subscribers who gave a score was the most important feature.
- Classification models are relatively accurate in determining whether a video game will be a hit or not.
